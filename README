OGLFTX
======

My attempt at modifying the OGLFT library ( see http://oglft.sourceforge.net/ )
for use in OpenGL version 3.2+ contexts.

Commits marked as 'Interim' ought not be built from.

Significant alterations/decisions :

    - replacement of display list implementation with buffer objects
    - removal of Qt aspects ( as I have no idea about that )
    - factorisation of monolithic files to per-class
    - separating interface(s) from implementation(s)
    - some structures converted to classes with appropriate accessors/mutators
    - Doxygen commenting format
